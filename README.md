# RAG-LLM-App-Using-Llamaindex-and-OpenAI
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app that leverages the power of LlamaIndex and OpenAI’s language models to index PDF documents and provide context-aware responses to user queries. The app is designed to improve the speed and accuracy of information retrieval by using advanced large language models (LLMs) and document indexing.

Project Overview

The RAG LLM app allows users to upload and query PDF documents by asking questions in natural language. The app returns contextually relevant answers, improving user experience in terms of document-based information retrieval. It is ideal for scenarios where users need to extract key information from large documents, like research papers, legal contracts, or financial reports.

Features:
Efficient Document Indexing: Uses LlamaIndex to create an index of uploaded PDF documents for fast retrieval.

Context-Aware Querying: Queries are processed by OpenAI’s LLM, which provides detailed and accurate responses based on the document’s content.

Real-time Interaction: Users can ask questions and get responses quickly without manually searching through documents.



Usage
Upload PDFs: Once the app is running, you can upload one or more PDF documents through the web interface.

Query Documents: Type in your questions in natural language, and the app will return context-aware answers by retrieving information from the indexed documents.

Index Management: The app allows you to manage and update your indexed documents for better accuracy in responses.

Example Queries:
"What are the key findings in this report?"
"Summarize the conclusion section of the document."
"What does the document say about renewable energy?"
Technologies Used

LlamaIndex: For efficient indexing of PDF documents to enable quick retrieval of relevant content.

OpenAI LLM: To generate context-aware responses from the indexed documents.

Flask: The web framework used to create the interface for uploading documents and querying.

PyPDF2: Used for extracting text from PDF documents.
