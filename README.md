# RAG-LLM-App-Using-Llamaindex-and-OpenAI
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app that leverages the power of LlamaIndex and OpenAI’s language models to index PDF documents and provide context-aware responses to user queries. The app is designed to improve the speed and accuracy of information retrieval by using advanced large language models (LLMs) and document indexing.

Project Overview
The RAG LLM app allows users to upload and query PDF documents by asking questions in natural language. The app returns contextually relevant answers, improving user experience in terms of document-based information retrieval. It is ideal for scenarios where users need to extract key information from large documents, like research papers, legal contracts, or financial reports.

Features:
Efficient Document Indexing: Uses LlamaIndex to create an index of uploaded PDF documents for fast retrieval.
Context-Aware Querying: Queries are processed by OpenAI’s LLM, which provides detailed and accurate responses based on the document’s content.
Real-time Interaction: Users can ask questions and get responses quickly without manually searching through documents.
Installation
To get started with the app, follow the instructions below:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAG-LLM-PDF-Querying.git
cd RAG-LLM-PDF-Querying
Install Dependencies: The project requires Python 3.8+ and several other dependencies. You can install them using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
OpenAI API Key: You'll need to get your OpenAI API key to use the language model. Set up an environment variable as follows:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
Run the Application: Once everything is set up, you can start the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Web Interface: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to start uploading your PDFs and querying them.

Usage
Upload PDFs: Once the app is running, you can upload one or more PDF documents through the web interface.

Query Documents: Type in your questions in natural language, and the app will return context-aware answers by retrieving information from the indexed documents.

Index Management: The app allows you to manage and update your indexed documents for better accuracy in responses.

Example Queries:
"What are the key findings in this report?"
"Summarize the conclusion section of the document."
"What does the document say about renewable energy?"
Technologies Used
LlamaIndex: For efficient indexing of PDF documents to enable quick retrieval of relevant content.
OpenAI LLM: To generate context-aware responses from the indexed documents.
Flask: The web framework used to create the interface for uploading documents and querying.
PyPDF2: Used for extracting text from PDF documents.
